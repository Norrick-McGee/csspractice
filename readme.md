Made a fun little repo where I can practice writing CSS to make cool things.
The code doesn't need to be perfect, I just want to get experience writing cool visuals in CSS and HTML for the sake of practice :)

Just trying to get my feet wet in the world of WebDev/ Web Design

If anyone is reading this, feel free to let me know what you like or what you'd do better, or maybe even another cool thing you'd like to see my try.
